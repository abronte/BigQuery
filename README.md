# BigQuery

BigQuery is a wrapper around the Google api ruby gem designed to make interacting with BigQuery easier.

## Install

    gem install bigquery

## Authorization

Only service accounts are supported right now. https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#serviceaccount

## Available methods

* query
* tables
* load
* tables_formatted
* job
* jobs
* refresh_auth

## Example

    require 'big_query'

    opts = {}
    opts['client_id']     = '1234.apps.googleusercontent.com'
    opts['service_email'] = '1234@developer.gserviceaccount.com'
    opts['key']           = '/path/to/somekeyfile-privatekey.p12'
    opts['project_id']    = '54321'
    opts['dataset']       = 'yourdataset'

    bq = BigQuery::Client.new(opts)

    puts bq.tables

## Tables

List tables in dataset

    bq.tables

List table names

    bq.tables_formatted

Fetch table data

    bq.table_data('table_name')

Delete exiting table

    bq.delete_table('test123')

Create table. First param is the table name second one is the table schema defined with the following format

    {
        field_name: {
            type: 'TYPE_VALUE BETWEEN (STRING, INTEGER, FLOAT, BOOLEAN, RECORD, TIMESTAMP)',
            mode: 'MODE_VALUE BETWEEN (NULLABLE, REQUIRED, REPEATED)'
        },
        other_field_name: { ... }
    }


As this example defines

    table_name = 'test123'
    table_schema = { id: { type: 'INTEGER' },
                     name: { type: 'STRING' } }
    bq.create_table(table_name, table_schema)

Describe table schema

    bq.describe_table('table_name')

## Query

You can either select

    bq.query("SELECT * FROM [#{config['dataset']}.table_name] LIMIT 1")

Or insert

    bq.insert('table_name', 'id' => 123, 'type' => 'Task')

## Keys

To get the keys you need to have a:

* google API project (link)[https://console.developers.google.com/project]
* bigquery activated (link)[https://bigquery.cloud.google.com]
* create a bigquery dataset in the project (link)[https://bigquery.cloud.google.com]

1- Goto your project google api access

https://code.google.com/apis/console/b/0/?noredirect&pli=1#project:YOUR_PROJECT_ID:access

2- Create a new client-ID for service_account
3- Download de key file

Now you have everything:

* client_id: API access client-ID
* service_email: API access Email address
* key: API access key file path
* project_id: your google API project id
* dataset: your big query dataset name

## Troubleshooting

If you're getting an "invalid_grant" error it usually means your system clock is off.

If you're getting unauthorized requested but you've been able to successfully connect before, you need to refresh your auth by running the "refresh_auth" method.

## How to run test

Before run test, you must create file named `.bigquery_settings.yml` on root of this repository. `.bigquery_settings.yml` must include following infomation.

```yaml
client_id:     '1234.apps.googleusercontent.com'
service_email: '1234@developer.gserviceaccount.com'
key:           '/path/to/somekeyfile-privatekey.p12'
project_id:    '54321'
dataset:       'yourdataset'
```

Then run tests via rake.

```
$ bundle install && bundle exec rake test
```
